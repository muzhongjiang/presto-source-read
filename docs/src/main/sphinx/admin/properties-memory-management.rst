Memory management properties
============================

``query.max-memory-per-node``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Type:** :ref:`prop-type-data-size`
* **Default value:** (JVM max memory * 0.3)

This is the max amount of user memory a query can use on a worker.
User memory is allocated during execution for things that are directly
attributable to, or controllable by, a user query. For example, memory used
by the hash tables built during execution, memory used during sorting, etc.
When the user memory allocation of a query on any worker hits this limit,
it is killed.

``query.max-memory``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Type:** :ref:`prop-type-data-size`
* **Default value:** ``20GB``

This is the max amount of user memory a query can use across the entire cluster.
User memory is allocated during execution for things that are directly
attributable to, or controllable by, a user query. For example, memory used
by the hash tables built during execution, memory used during sorting, etc.
When the user memory allocation of a query across all workers hits this limit
it is killed.

``query.max-total-memory``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Type:** :ref:`prop-type-data-size`
* **Default value:** (``query.max-memory`` * 2)

This is the max amount of memory a query can use across the entire cluster,
including revocable memory. When the memory allocated by a query across all
workers hits this limit it is killed. The value of ``query.max-total-memory``
must be greater than ``query.max-memory``.

``query.max-memory-per-task``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Type:** :ref:`prop-type-data-size`
* **Default value:** none, and therefore unrestricted
* **Session property:** ``query_max_total_memory_per_task``

This is the max amount of the memory a task can use on a node in the
cluster. Support for using this property is experimental only.

``memory.heap-headroom-per-node``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Type:** :ref:`prop-type-data-size`
* **Default value:** (JVM max memory * 0.3)

This is the amount of memory set aside as headroom/buffer in the JVM heap
for allocations that are not tracked by Trino.
