## Development

See [DEVELOPMENT](.github/DEVELOPMENT.md) for information about code style,
development process, and guidelines.

See [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution requirements.

## Security

information about reporting vulnerabilities.

## Build requirements

* Mac OS X or Linux
* Java 11.0.11+, 64-bit
* Docker

## Building Trino

1、启动docker
2、执行build命令：
```shell
export JAVA_HOME=/Users/muzhongjiang/software/jdk-11.0.12.jdk/Contents/Home
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests  -X
```

Trino has a comprehensive set of tests that take a considerable amount of time
to run, and are thus disabled by the above command. These tests are run by the
CI system when you submit a pull request. We recommend only running tests
locally for the areas of code that you change.

## Running Trino in your IDE

### Overview

After building Trino for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE
and run the server.  We recommend using
[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Because Trino is a standard
Maven project, you easily can import it into your IDE.  In IntelliJ, choose
*Open Project* from the *Quick Start* box or choose *Open*
from the *File* menu and select the root `pom.xml` file.

After opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is
properly configured for the project:

* Open the File menu and select Project Structure
* In the SDKs section, ensure that JDK 11 is selected (create one if none exist)
* In the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to 11

### Running a testing server

The simplest way to run Trino for development is to run the `TpchQueryRunner`
class. It will start a development version of the server that is configured with
the TPCH connector. You can then use the CLI to execute queries against this
server. Many other connectors have their own `*QueryRunner` class that you can
use when working on a specific connector.

### Running the full server

Trino comes with sample configuration that should work out-of-the-box for
development. Use the following options to create a run configuration:

* Main Class: `io.trino.server.DevelopmentServer`
* VM Options: `-ea -Dconfig=etc/config.properties -Dlog.levels-file=etc/log.properties -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true`
* Working directory: `$MODULE_DIR$`
* Use classpath of module: `trino-server-dev`

The working directory should be the `trino-server-dev` subdirectory. In
IntelliJ, using `$MODULE_DIR$` accomplishes this automatically.

If `VM options` doesn't exist in the dialog, you need to select `Modify options`
and enable `Add VM options`.

### Running the CLI

Start the CLI to connect to the server and run SQL queries:

    client/trino-cli/target/trino-cli-*-executable.jar

Run a query to see the nodes in the cluster:

    SELECT * FROM system.runtime.nodes;

Run a query against the TPCH connector:

    SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.region;
